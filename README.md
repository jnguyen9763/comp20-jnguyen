COMP 20 Fall 2018 Private Repo for Jacqueline Nguyen

This repository holds my labs and projects from COMP 20. 

So far, my favorite project has been the MBTA assignment since I got to learn a lot about APIs and it was cool creating something that I could interact with in my browser. 

I've definitely learned a lot since Day 1. Not only did I learn a lot about the web and making web applications, but I also grew as a programmer since now I know more about different languages and applications, like Javascript and Heroku.

Some important things I learned from this course are 1) making web applications is really complicated since there's a lot of things you have to implement in the frontend and backend and 2) NEVER TRUST USERS' INPUT!

I would be interested in learning more about backend. It would be nice to understand more about what is happening and to learn how to write efficient code.
