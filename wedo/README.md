# Creating Subtitles with DOM and Event Listeners
Everything seems to be implemented correctly based on the HTML and CSS validators. The subtitles work and appear at their intended times so the JavaScript seems fine as well.

I didn't collaborate with anyone but I relied on the Double Rainbow example from the "examples" folder on GitHub.

This lab took approximately 3 hours to complete.
