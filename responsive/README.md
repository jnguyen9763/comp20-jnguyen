# Responsive CSS Sprites
In the beginning, I had trouble making the sprites render until I changed min-device-width to min-width. After figuring that out, I was able to implement everything else correctly. However, what I notice from testing is that it would only work on a Chrome browser and not a Firefox one. I wasn't able to figure out why nothing was rendering on Firefox.

I didn't collaborate with anyone. I used the given references and Stack Overflow to resolve the min-device-width problem.

It took approximately 1.5 hours to complete the lab.
