# Responsive CSS Sprites
In the beginning, I had trouble making the sprites render until I changed min-device-width to min-width. I also had trouble getting it to work on Firefox until I saw the Piazza post. After figuring those out, I was able to implement everything else correctly.

I didn't collaborate with anyone. I used the given references, Stack Overflow to resolve the min-device-width problem, and the Piazza post for the Firefox compatibility issue. 

It took approximately 1.5 hours to complete the lab.
