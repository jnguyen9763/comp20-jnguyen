# Closest MBTA Station

I think I've correctly implemented the markers for the user and stations as well as their corresponding info windows. I was able to get the info windows to display the most recent data from the MBTA API when the user clicks on one. I think the info window for the user was also done correctly. However, there are a few things I would like to work on if I revisit this project. For instance, I think there's a better way to display the info windows, since sometimes they block each other or they'll pop up under another opened info window.

I asked a clarification question about Geolocation on Piazza and Ming answered it. Also, I did use a lot of sources.
- Google's Documentation of the Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
- Hayden's recommendation for icons (https://icons8.com/)
- StackOverflow for drawing multiple polylines and having multiple info windows (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50332798/drawing-multiple-polylines-in-google-maps-javascript-api, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11106671/google-maps-api-multiple-markers-with-infowindows)
- Examples from this class's GitHub, particularly the object keys example and the ajax message example
- Sources from MDN, w3schools, and Love2Dev to learn about Math.round(), html table, and .substring() function (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round, https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp, https://love2dev.com/blog/javascript-substring-substr-slice/)

This assignment took approximately 11 hours.
