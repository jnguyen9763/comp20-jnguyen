# Captain's Log

In the beginning, I was struggling to find a good way to sort the keys of 
localStorage in order to keep the proper order of the messages. However, I
ended up figuring it out, so I believe I implemented everything correctly.

I relied on the website's notes about jQuery and data persistence, especially
the provided example for localStorage. I also used a video on YouTube that
introduces jQuery to beginners, which helped me get used to the library. Also,
the piazza posts helped me figure out how to maintain the order of the messages.

The lab took around 2 hours.
