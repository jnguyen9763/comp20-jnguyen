# Assignment 4: Security

I think I covered all bases in my report.

I collaborated with Phan Anh for the bash script since I didn't know how to make one. I also used StackOverflow to learn more about bash scripts and fix minor problems. Notes on security from the Web Programming website also helped.

This assignment took around 2 hours.
