        <h1>Assignment 4: Security</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The goal of this assignment was to find security vulnerabilities in the 2048 servers we created for Assignment 3. For this assignment, I was assigned Ming's 2048 game server to play with.</p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>I decided to run Ming's code locally since other people were using his Heroku server. I also cloned the original 2048 game and made changes based on Ming's piazza post.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>First, I tried to send a script to the serverside using the prompt form from the 2048 client. When I got the prompt to pop up, I sent "&ltscript>while(true){alert("Hi");}&lt/script>" to the server.</p></li>
            <li><p>Another method that I tried was the [$ne] trick shown in class. Since I hosted the server locally, I typed "http://localhost:3000/scores.json?username[$ne]=watermelon" into the browser.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lastly, I created a bash script that would continually send query strings to the serverside. My script looked like this:</p><p>#!/bin/bash</p><p>while true; do curl --data "username=apple&score=100&grid={}" http://localhost:3000/submit; done</p><p>I would run the script on my terminal.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Cross site scripting occurs when a user inputs in code instead of standard text in a text box, for exmaple, from forms or logins. When the code gets sent over to a server, it can prohibit other users from using the site or redirect them to another page. Hence, it can pose security risk to any user that uses the site. </p></li>
            <li><p>An injection attack happens when a user is able to get any information from the server using query strings. Query strings are like refined searches. So instead of returning specific information from the server based on the query string, if a user decides to modify the query string to release all information that the server stores, it can pose a privacy risk to all users.</p></li>
            <li><p>Overloading a database can happen if a user repeatedly sends the server information. The user can do this by coding a loop that will continuously run, sending useless information infinitely. This can pose a problem for the website if it heavily depends on the dataase. If the database can no longer hold anymore data, then the site can lose a big part of its functionality.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Issues Found</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Cross Site Scripting</h3><p>Location: Both clientside and serverside</p><p>Severity of issue: High</p><p>Since I used a while loop, it makes it impossible for users to play 2048 or check the high scores on Heroku. The only way to get rid of the problem is to clear out the entry on the database, which can be hard to do if the implementer is not aware of the attack or if there are a lot of entries in the database.</p><p>Description of issue:</p><p><img src="#" alt="XSS attack" /></p><p>Resolution: You can strip all user input from special characters so that the script will not work.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Injection Attack</h3><p>Location: Serverside</p><p>Severity of issue: High</p><p>This issue can be really serious depending on what type of information the database is holding. Since the 2048 game server is only holding scores, it may not seem so bad. However, if the server was holding personal, sensitive information then it poses a serious privacy risks to users.</p><p>Description of issue:</p><p><img src="#" alt="Injection attack" /></p><p>Resolution: From the serverside, it can check if the query has any operators like $ and ignore the query to prevent leaking sensitive information.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Database Overload</h3><p>Location: Serverside</p><p>Severity of issue: Medium</p><p>All my script does it try to overload the database, which can take a really long time depending on the size of the database. Hence, it's not a serious problem where user's information may be leaked but it can prevent users from using the application if the database does fill up.</p><p>Description of issue:</p><p><img src="#" alt="Overloading the database" /></p><p>Resolution: The server should only accept a limited number of query strings for a certain duration. This can prevent the server from being overloaded quickly. Also, if it can detect where the query strings are coming from (e.g. IP address), then it can block queries from that address.</p></li>
